# rp-radio
All credits go to Frazzle for making this, this is just an adapted version for pma-voice.

#### Note
By default the radio is disabled (its meant to be used as an in-game item) to give players the radio by default in the client.lua at the top change `Radio.Has` to `true`, if you would like to make it an item look at the replies on the FiveM forum post, there is a tutorial for adding it as an ESX item.

The export that is used to give/take a players radio is `exports["rp-radio"]:SetRadio(true/false)` or the event `Radio.Set`
